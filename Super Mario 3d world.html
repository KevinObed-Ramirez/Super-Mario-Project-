            Super Mario 3D world
    The game follows Mario and friends attempting to rescue fairy-like creatures called Sprixies from Bowser,
    who invades the realm known as the Sprixie Kingdom.
    Mario and his friends (Peach, Luigi, Blue Toad, and Roselina)
    travel to the Sprixie Kingdom to free all the Sprixies.
    After freeing the last one,
    Bowser retreats to his amusement park and uses a super bell to turn himself into "Meowser" (a cat-like Bowser).
    Mario and the crew then defeat Bowser,
    free the Sprixies and go home to the Mushroom Kingdom.
    
    Release Date: November 22, 2013
